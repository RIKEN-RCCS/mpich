This document discusses some of the new features added to the MPICH-based MPI
implementation for the Aurora computer and the environment variables (CVARs)
that the user can set to modify its behavior. MPICH is configured to use
sensible default values for all the environment variables to provide overall
good performance. However, users can change those defaults values to better tune
their applications. This report provides documentation on how those CVARS work
and the possible values that they can take. This documentation also provides
information about per-communicator info hints that MPICH utilizes to make
runtime decisions at a finer granularity.

Notice that performance of the application depends on how ranks are mapped to
the cores of the processor. For information on how to specify process-core
binding with mpirun, information is provided here:

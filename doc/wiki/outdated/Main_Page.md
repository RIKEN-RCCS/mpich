<big>Welcome to the MPICH wiki</big>

Downloads and lots of other great information can be found at the [main
MPICH website](http://www.mpich.org/). This wiki hosts most of our
[Developer Documentation](Developer_Documentation "wikilink"), along
with other random content as appropriate. Please bear with us on this
site as we are in the process of moving our documentation from the old
website over to the wiki and the new website.

For a new developer, it is highly recommended to read the following
pages before contributing: [Version Control Systems
101](Version_Control_Systems_101 "wikilink"), [Git usage in
MPICH](Git "wikilink"), [:Category:Design
Documents](:Category:Design_Documents "wikilink") and [Coding
Standards](Coding_Standards "wikilink").

If you are an MPICH developer and you have a bit of free time, please
sign in and help port over some of the old content to the pages listed
in [:Category:Stubs](:Category:Stubs "wikilink").
